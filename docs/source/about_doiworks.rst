Alice, Bob & Peter
------------------
On blockchains we send transactions from A to B. In the past we started calling A – Alice and B – Bob.
We want to reuse this tradition and add another party Peter. 

Peter is an usual email user subscribing to a newsletter at Alice’s ordinary website.
Alice is a brand, an e-commerce platform or another email marketing party, which intends to send an email to Peter. 
Doing so Alice submits a Doi-request-transaction to the Doichain blockchain and pays a set of fees for that process. 
(Please see: How much does it cost to store a Double Opt-In inside Doichain?)

Bob is in best case the email provider of Peter, which receives the Doi-request-transaction from Alice 
and hands out the Doi-request-email to Peter. Peters email confirmation (DOI) gets submitted in a second transaction into 
Doichain. Bob receives a reward from Alice for validating Peters email for Alice.

In case Peters ESP or ISP doesn't run a Doichain validator yet. DoiWorks provides a fallback validator until 
Peters ESP decides to setup a Doichain validator for its users.
Please read on: How Self-Decentralizing System

Self Decentralizing System
--------------------------
I critical analyst of the Doiworks Double Opt-In Protocol might instantly remark, that a centralized fallback 
validator isn't a good solution according to decentralized blockchain principles. To answer this question 
it needs to be pointed out that a fallback Doichain validator is only necessary until the time when every bigger email provider 
is running a DoiWorks validator. Everbody who doesn't like the centralized approach of the Doichain validator 
can run its own node when ever he likes in a decentralized way for it's own responsible email domains. 

Further on we want to refer to the chapter "Email Domain Rewards And Staking"
